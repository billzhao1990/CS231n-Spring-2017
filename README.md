# CS231n-Spring-2017

This repo is to place my solutions to the assignments on course [Stanford CS231n Spring 2017](http://cs231n.github.io/). 

Besides, I also give the explanations on my codes.

The IPython Notebook knn.ipynb will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points) -- DONE!

The IPython Notebook svm.ipynb will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.

Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points) -- DONE!
